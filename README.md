# listuser

Listuser displays the views of the listuser API. This tool was created as part of a technical test. The listuser application was specifically developed for the vau_ui_technical_test repository using the TypeScript programming language along with the React.js framework.

The main objective of Listuser is to demonstrate an efficient and simple way of how the listuser-api works in real-time. Below are some key features of this application:

1. User Creation: Allows adding new users with the necessary basic information.
2. User Listing: Provides a complete list of all registered users.
3. User Update: Facilitates the updating of existing user information.
4. User Deletion: Allows deleting users from the list of records.
